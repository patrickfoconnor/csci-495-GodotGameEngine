A repo for sharing notes, tips, and projects with Dr. Paxton of the Gianforte School of Computer @ Montana State University

## First game following guide
This game is a simple 2D avoid your enemies game in which your main character is controlled via wasd in classic pc gaming style.

The guide for this <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html">here</a>. 

All source code and the .exe is available and runnable currently on Windows 10.


## General notes about the Godot Game Engine

- I would suggest strongly focusing on focusing on the understanding of nodes and the interactions that are available with specific nodes. Even after an entire summer of researching and learning about the nodes this is still a struggle point (See resource 1 for more information

- Searching for game resources while interesting and exciting can be a major pain point for someone looking to learn godot and gdscript from the ground up

- As with many students in the class(I would assume) a basic introduction to game design would be quite helpful after understanding a ground level of the node system
	- If these student have already taken python or even better a java class transitioning to gdscript will be relatively simple 
		- Although signals and mapping those signals to 

## Great resources for exploration outside the general documentation that can be found at 

Not the greatest as it requires an email but is completely monetarily free. https://www.gdquest.com/node-essentials-guides/

- An excellent book that is very comprehensive and only $20 https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=3gBRDwAAQBAJ&pg=GBS.PA1&hl=en
	- This book while it states 24hrs could be introduced as an entire year long course of information



### Some great game engine open source resources

- https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset
- https://opengameart.org/
- https://letsmakegames.org/resources/art-assets-for-game-developers/
- https://pixelprospector.com/ (Need to use the old site as it is being updated at the moment)
- https://freesound.org/ (Great resource for sounds)


## Some pain points that I found while exploring Godot

- The game gets bloated fast even within the tutorial 
	- depending on the pc that the student is using this may cause serious problem
		- This gave me flashbacks to robotics in which I and many other students struggled to do developing within the webots application as it is a resource heavy application.Overall revelative to other game engines it is lightweight but whether that is lightweight enough for exchange students to do on their laptops.
