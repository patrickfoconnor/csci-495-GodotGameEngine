
## General Tips and Painpoints for exploring and learning the GoDot Game Engine

- The game gets bloated fast even within the tutorial 
- Avoid complex signals and scenes until a basic understanding of nodes is held
    - After an understanding of nodes is achieved the interactions that are available with specific nodes will be much clearer making development much easier.
- When beginning stick to as few scenes as possible. As progression happens, scene size and quantity will increase naturally
- Don't be afraid to use already designed game assets instead of alternatives such as blender
  - If possible ask your professor, mentor, or TA for some tips or examples if needed
- Proper design and planning will save many hours when actually creating/coding the game
  - Would advise adding some sort of basic introduction to game design
- It is a good idea to start with a tutorial and build on a feature that you find interesting
- Stray away from 3D games unless you are extremely passionate about game design and have previous experience with OOP languages such as java
- Utilizing GDScript will increase efficiency and there are some great libraries available already compared to the newer version accepting C#
- Don't be afraid to watch videos on youtube. While they might not be exactly what you are trying to accomplish they will have great tips. (DONT EXPECT TO LEARN WITHOUT CODING THOUGH)
- When in doubt reference the godot documentation. It is quite good for such an early engine and the editor can access it without changing windows.


- As with many students in the class(I would assume) a basic introduction to game design would be quite helpful after understanding a ground level of the node system
	- If these student have already taken python or even better a java class transitioning to gdscript will be relatively simple 
		- Although signals and mapping those signals to
